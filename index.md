## The (unofficial) list of astro & cosmo meetings at the University of Michigan

This site maintains a list of UM meetings in astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology. These include, but not limited to, open group meetings, journal clubs, seminars and colloquiums. Meetings are typically 1-hour long, unless specified otherwise. For meetings which are held remotely or hybrid, a Zoom link is included. Please ask the organizer(s) for password if prompted.

Also note that meetings can be held either weekly or bi-weekly. The latter is indicated by a [B] following their names. Bi-weekly meetings that alternate are denoted with an [A].

If you know some meetings that should be added to this list, please kindly contact me.
